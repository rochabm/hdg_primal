# Hybrid discontinuous Galerkin finite element method formulations (hdg-primal)

This repository is the code used to develop the paper "Stabilized hybrid discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the cardiac monodomain equation".
It is based on FORTRAN and PETSc for linear algebra operations.

### Comments:
- for PETSc integration you need to name files with upper case.
- another convention, used by the GFortran compiler, is to use upper-case extensions to denote files which should be processed by the C preprocessor.
